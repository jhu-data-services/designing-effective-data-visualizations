## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device." — John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
- There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use).

## ggplot2 $\in$ tidyverse

.pull-left[
# ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",fig.align="center"}
# knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot2-part-of-tidyverse.png")
# ```
]
.pull-right[
```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package
- The `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics
- It is inspired by the book **Grammar of Graphics** by Leland Wilkinson

## Grammar of Graphics

A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic.

# ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%",fig.align="center"}
# knitr::include_graphics("img/grammar-of-graphics.png")
# ```
